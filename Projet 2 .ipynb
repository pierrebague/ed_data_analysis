Primary. Rural is the number of rural children in the official primary school age range who are not attending primary or secondary education, expressed as a percentage of rural children of the official primary school age range. By definition, children in the official primary-age range, who are attending pre-primary education, are considered out-of-school. The sum of the net primary attendance rate and the proportion out of school do not add to 100 percent because the net primary attendance rate does not count students who are in secondary.   \n",

The listening comprehension subtask examines students' ability to respond correctly to questions about a brief passage read aloud to the student by the assessor in order to understand students’ ability to comprehend orally without having to overcome issues of decoding. Part of comprehension is understanding the meanings of the words, thus if students do not have enough vocabulary in the language, they will not be able to comprehend.
